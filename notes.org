org-notify is only for deadlines -- not very useful for me I think
you want something that will alert on scheduled things, not deadline things

conclusion on this one -- org-ql timestamp compare

-- try out dired copy paste operations/do they persist when you aggressively cull the dired buffers
like you do
-- maybe add a dired focus hook to refresh the display, irritating when the reference is
old

maybe just treat some mark as implicit paste target for a keybind
add a hook for on evil yank and then remove it on yank?

*** TODO idea: jump to input prompt area keybind
- deadgrep
- comint prompt area
- irc message prompt?

in deadgrep mode, a keybind to change the search, and filetype
(jumping back to the top is getting annoying) also for comint
mode/shell, irc... (think I will use nf)

This hasn't happened because it's not _super_ inconvienent to gg or G to where I need to go

*** TODO layout saver
idea: experiment with a keybind for saving layout and then restoring it later - maybe you could even
name layouts

maybe come back to this -- I don't like the live editing in the minibuffer because you then can't get the query you made very easily. Maybe we can come back and use like a standalone buffer to highlight in a test output or something

really this is just melpa index issues? can still workaround with ns/use-package, ugh
*** pinebook pro dotfiles issues

need to support more fallback terms -- konsole is what shippped with it -- maybe scrape a list from arch wiki
